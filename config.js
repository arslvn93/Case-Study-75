From the mortgage broker to the lawyer to the trades people—everyone treated us like we mattered. Shar never pushed us when we needed time, educated us so we felt confident, and fought for us when sellers tried to bully us into giving up our conditions. We're not even 30 yet and we own a home in the exact neighbourhood we love. We didn't have to settle, and we didn't overpay. That's because Shar had our backs every single step of the way.\"\"<br><span>— Satisfied Client</span>"
